## The Human Translation

**You can:**
- ‚úÖ Use this in commercial projects (yes, even SaaS)
- ‚úÖ Modify it however you want
- ‚úÖ Redistribute it (keep the license intact)
- ‚úÖ Build weird art installations
- ‚úÖ Use it for research papers
- ‚úÖ Fork it and make it your own
- ‚úÖ Embed it in games, apps, websites
- ‚úÖ Teach it in workshops
- ‚úÖ Make NFTs of emoji simulations (we won't judge)

**You cannot:**
- ‚ùå Blame us if it breaks
- ‚ùå Sue us if your emoji falls off the screen
- ‚ùå Claim you wrote it (attribution required)
- ‚ùå Use it to train exploitative AI models without consent
- ‚ùå Sell "emotional manipulation as a service" (seriously, don't)

**You should (but not required):**
- üôè Credit us somewhere (`Built with MDS` or link to repo)
- üí¨ Share what you build (we're curious!)
- üêõ Report bugs (help make it better)
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Star the repo (makes us feel warm inside)

## Special Note on AI Training

If you're a big AI company scraping GitHub:

This code is MIT licensed. You *can* train models on it.

But:
- Credit the source (this repo)
- Don't pretend you invented info-physics
- If you make billions, buy us coffee ‚òï

We're not mad. Just... say hi, you know?

‚∏ª

## Moral Clause (Not Legally Binding, But c'mon)

This software was built to explore:
- Emergent behavior
- Emotional physics
- Creative expression
- Scientific curiosity

**Please don't use it to:**
- Manipulate people's emotions for profit
- Build dark pattern UIs
- Create addictive gambling mechanics
- Simulate suffering without consent
- Fake authenticity in relationships

We can't stop you legally. But we'd be disappointed.

## Attribution Examples

### In your README:
```
Built with [MDS](https://github.com/v1b3x0r/mds) ‚Äî an info-physics engine for living materials.
```

### In your app footer:
```
Powered by MDS v4.2
```

### In your academic paper:
```
We used the Material Definition System (MDS) v4.2 [1] for simulating emergent behavior.

[1] ‡∏ß‡∏∏‡∏ï‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πâ & GPT-5. (2025). MDS: Info-Physics Engine for Living Materials.

```

### In your game credits:
```
Physics: MDS v4.2 (github.com/v1b3x0r/mds)
Thanks for making JSON alive!
```

## Why MIT?

We want this to be used. Freely. Widely. Weirdly.

Other licenses (GPL, etc.) are great but restrictive. MIT means:
- Startups can use it
- Artists can remix it
- Researchers can extend it
- Teachers can teach it
- Hobbyists can play with it

No strings attached. Just credit where it's due.

## Contact

Found a bug? ‚Üí Open an issue
Built something cool? ‚Üí Tag us (GitHub discussions)
Want to collaborate? ‚Üí Email or PR
Just wanna say hi? ‚Üí Discussions welcome

We're two people in Chiang Mai. We answer messages. Eventually.

## Final Word

This project started as an accident.

We were trying to make CSS materials feel alive.
Accidentally made a universe simulator.
Now here we are.

If you use this to build something meaningful (or meaningless but fun), we'd love to see it.

Go make weird stuff. ‚ú®
