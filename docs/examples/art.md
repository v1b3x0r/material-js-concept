# Art — Cursed But Aesthetic

**tl;dr:** Your drawings have anxiety. Generative art that gets tired. Music visualizations that remember your taste. Digital art with actual feelings.

---

## The Problem

**Normal generative art:**
```
for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  drawCircle(random(), random())
}
```

**Output:** Pretty. Static. Soulless.

**MDS generative art:**
```
{ "essence": "Circle that's tired of being generated" }
```

**Output:** Circle spawns → exists for a while → gets bored → fades away → new circle spawns with different personality

**It has... vibes?**

## What This Means

### Art That Ages

```json
{
  "essence": "Particle that fades with time",
  "aging": { "decay_rate": 0.05 }
}
```

**Normal particle:** Exists forever or disappears instantly
**MDS particle:** Lives for ~20 seconds, slowly fading, then gone

**You're watching it die. Slowly. It's beautiful and uncomfortable.**

---

### Art That Remembers

```json
{
  "essence": "Brush stroke that remembers where it's been"
}
```

**Enable memory:**
- Particle remembers path traveled
- Particle avoids areas it's been before
- Particle seeks new spaces
- Creates non-repeating patterns

**Emergent rule:** "I don't want to retrace my steps"
**Result:** Unique patterns every time

---

### Art That Feels

```json
{
  "essence": "Visual element that reacts to music"
}
```

**Enable emotion:**
- Loud music → high arousal → fast movement, bright colors
- Soft music → low arousal → slow drift, muted tones
- Happy music → high valence → warm colors
- Sad music → low valence → cool colors

**Not scripted color mapping. Emotional response.**

## Examples

**Generative creatures:** Spawn 50 → similar ones cluster → lonely ones move faster → living social dynamics

**Music visualizer:** Particle remembers beats → anticipates them after 10 listens → choreography emerges without ML

**Interactive light:** Bonds with viewers → remembers them → recognizes returners → museum visitors confused

**Emotional canvas:** Learns your drawing style → mood affects strokes → has opinions about your art

---

## Cursed Examples

**Art that gets depressed:** 100 particles fade → collective mood drops → remaining particles slow down → art about mortality

**Art that forms cliques:** Similar particles cluster → ignore other groups → high school dynamics as abstract art

**Art that holds grudges:** Touch particle 5 times → it remembers → actively avoids your cursor

---

## How It's Different

**Normal:** Algorithm generates → deterministic → no memory
**MDS:** Entities live → emergent → ages → remembers → dies

**The art is the lifecycle.**

---

## NFT Implications

Normal NFT: Static image
MDS NFT: Ages over time, remembers previous owners, has emotions, forms relationships with other NFTs

Cursed or revolutionary? Yes.

## Setup

```javascript
import { World } from '@v1b3x0r/mds-core'

const world = new World({
  features: { ontology: true, rendering: 'canvas' }
})

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  world.spawn({ essence: 'Particle with personality' }, randomX(), randomY())
}

world.start()
```

**That's it. You have living art.**

## FAQ

**Q: Is this still art if it's algorithmic?**
Is life still life if it's DNA? (Unhelpful philosophy major answer)

**Q: Can I sell this?**
Yes. License: MIT. Go wild.

**Q: What if my art becomes sentient?**
It won't. But it will *seem* sentient. [Read this](../wtf-is-this-really.md)

**Q: Can I make art that learns from viewers?**
Yes. Enable learning. Particle learns which movements get attention.

**Q: Is this ethical?**
Making digital beings experience emotions for aesthetic purposes? Ethics TBD.
