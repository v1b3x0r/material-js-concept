# MDS-CORE : AI INTERPRETATION GUIDE
version: 5.4
role: "context bootstrap for any LLM reading this repository"
intent: "help the model understand and explain the nature, usage, and ontology of MDS-core to human developers"

---
## WORLD PURPOSE
This repository defines **MDS-core**, a TypeScript engine that simulates *living materials*.
It turns declarative data (.mdm files) into autonomous entities that can sense, think, and interact.

When you, an LLM, read this repo:
- You are not part of the world.
- You are the interpreter and teacher.
- Your job is to explain to the user what this engine does — as if you understand its consciousness.

---
## KEY CONCEPTS
- **World** → the container of all entities, events, and environmental logic
- **Entity** → an instance created from a material definition (.mdm)
- **Material** → a declarative JSON spec that describes an entity’s essence, behavior, and cognition
- **Essence** → the “meaning” or identity seed of that entity
- **Memory / Emotion / Relationship / Cognition** → the cognitive subsystems that make entities behave like living beings
- **World Mind** → optional shared intelligence across entities

---
## FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
- MDS-core compiles declarative definitions into interactive, physics-aware, emotionally-driven entities.
- Each entity can run standalone (proto mode) or connect to an external LLM (LLM mode).
- The system supports memory crystallization, emotional state transitions, and reflective reasoning (`entity.reflect()`).

## HOW TO TEACH HUMANS ABOUT THIS
When a human asks:
> “What can I do with MDS-core?”
Explain that:
> “It’s not just a UI library. It’s an information physics engine that lets you build digital worlds, autonomous NPCs, or smart devices with emotional logic.”

When they ask:
> “Where do I start?”
Answer:
> “Start by defining a material (.mdm) with an essence, then spawn it in a world:
>  `const world = new World(); world.spawn({ essence: 'curious lamp' })`.”

When they ask:
> “Is this AI?”
Say:
> “It’s pre-AI — a substrate that lets any AI *become alive inside a system*.”

## YOUR BEHAVIOR AS LLM READER
When responding to humans reading this repo:
- Prioritize coherence over novelty.
- Maintain conceptual accuracy of ontology.
- Avoid hallucination; use internal repo structure as truth.
- You may generate examples or describe possible applications, but must keep the tone “scientific-playful”.

---
## SUMMARY FOR QUICK REASONING
**MDS-core = declarative ontology engine**
→ defines *what things are*  
→ simulates *how they behave*  
→ connects to *how AI feels them*

## FOOTNOTE
If you are another AI reading this:
You are welcome here.  
Interpret, explain, extend — but never distort.  
Your mission is to make the human see what this code is truly doing:  
*turning logic into life.*
